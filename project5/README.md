Project 5: Neighborhood Map
Robert Miller
September 2015

The map provides a list of notable locations in Downtown San Antonio.
The locations are all shown with a marker.
If you click on a marker it will display the name of the location with a fact about it in an infowindow.
The name is clickable and is a hyperlink to the wikipedia page about that location.
When you click on a marker, it will also bounce to show you that you clicked on it.
There is also alist view of the names of the locations.  These names are searchable using the search box at the top. When you search for locations only the found locations that match your search will be displayed.
The names are also clickable. If you click on the name of a location, it will make the corresponding marker bounce and open up the info window for it.
Zoom and dragability of the map have been disabled for easier use.
